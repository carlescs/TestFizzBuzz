# Test Changelog PR Workflow

This file validates that the changelog generation workflow has been successfully updated to work with pull requests instead of direct commits to master.

## Changes Made

1. **Workflow Trigger**: Changed from `github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'` to `github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.base_ref == 'master'`

2. **Commit Target**: Changed from `git push` to `git push origin HEAD:${{ github.head_ref }}` to push to PR branch

3. **Process Flow**:
   - PR created targeting master → Changelog generated
   - Changelog committed to PR branch → Included in PR diff
   - PR merged to master → Release created using existing changelog

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ Changelog generation runs on PRs to master
- ✅ No direct commits to master from pipeline
- ✅ Changelog updates appear in PR diff before merge
- ✅ Release creation works on master using committed changelog

## Validation

This test file commit should trigger the changelog generation workflow when this branch is opened as a PR targeting master.
